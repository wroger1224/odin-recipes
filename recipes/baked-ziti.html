    <p class="desc">Do you like lasagna, but not the fuss? Make baked ziti instead!
        It's a lot like a classic lasagna casserole, but easier to make and without 
        lots of layers or broken noodles. It makes for a perfect midweek or weekend 
        meal, or a hot dish to bring to a potluck. Make extra and freeze for later.

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ziti/penne/rotini pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or basi</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 cups jarred marinara or pasta sauce</li>
            <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>1 heaping cup ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a 
                little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you 
                make the sauce.</li>
            <li>Brown the meat: If you are using ground beef or pork instead of 
                sausage, sprinkle with a little salt.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions 
                and stir well to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are 
                translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.
                Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red 
                pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the 
                tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Assemble the casserole: Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the 
                bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with 
                half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, 
                stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole. Pour the 
                rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese 
                over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the 
                Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake uncovered in the oven at 350°F until the top is lightly 
                browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand 
                for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
