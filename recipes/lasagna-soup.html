    <p id="desc">Lasagna Soup features everything you love about lasagna
        – in one steaming bowl of delicious comfort. I first shared this 
        recipe way back in March 2011 – the first Lasagna Soup recipe to 
        hit the internet! It’s a time-tested recipe, a favorite with our 
        family and friends. Whenever someone asks me to recommend a recipe
        that’ll please the whole family, I point them straight to this one!

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add sausage
                and brown for 3 minutes, breaking it up into bite-size pieces 
                with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add onion, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes,
                and cook until onion is softened and sausage is browned, about 7
                more minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add diced tomatoes, bay leaves, and chicken stock. Bring just to
                a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare pasta in a separate saucepan according to 
                package directions, to el dente. Do not over cook. Drain.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, create the "cheesy yum" by combining the ricotta, 
                Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir fresh basil into soup right before serving.</li>
            <li>To serve, add cooked pasta to individual bowls and ladle soup 
                over the top. Serve with dollops of cheesy yum and additional 
                shredded mozzarella.</li>
        </ol>
